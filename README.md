# The Mega64 Soundboard

Welcome to the Mega64 Soundboard. This small project was created from the desire to listen to favorite sound clips / quotes of the Mega64 Boyz. The project was created by me, but hopefully will grow and flourish and be driven by the Mega64 community.

Check out the soundboard [here](http://mega64soundboard.com/), and tweet/follow [@mega64board](https://twitter.com/mega64board)!

Weekly updates (hopefully)!

### Data Needed for Quotes
Please send quotes or quote information! The following are needed for an entire quote.

* The quote itself
* Link to video/sound file
* Timestamp of quote in video/sound file if possible
* Hi-Res photo of quotee to use as portrait (if does not exist)




### Quote Backlog

These are quotes that are missing some data and/or have not been added to the soundboard. If you know a source or a link, help speed up the process by sending it over! If I do not have the source/sound of a quote, I can add it to the board, but it will just not play any sound.

| Date | Quote | Quotee | Character | Source | Link | Submitted by: |
|:----:|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|:------:|:----:|:-------------:|
|1/31/2017|"Who is she, and is she nice?"|||???||Ignacio|
|1/31/2017|"Fuck the fuck no"|Derrick||???||Dr. Ryan|
|1/31/2017|"He's Eatin' Ass!"|Garrett||???||Dr. Ryan|

#### Future Plans

Currently the site is using jQuery, but I would like to rebuild the site using React, and possibly use Firebase to handle some data. I would like to finish the Favorites feature, and possibly add some kind of upvoting/downvoting functionality, so that it can be possible to see the quotes people love the most.
